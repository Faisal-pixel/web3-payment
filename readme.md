# CREATING A WEB 3 PROJECT

#### 1. Created a client folder which is where the react application will live

#### 2. Created a server folder which is where the solidity contract will go.

#### 3. While creating the react using vite, i set the project name to ./ to let it know that the project is in the current directory.

#### 4. now in the smart_contract I run npm init -y to create a package.json file.
