# CREATING A WEB 3 PROJECT

#### 1. Created a client folder which is where the react application will live

#### 2. Created a server folder which is where the solidity contract will go.

#### 3. While creating the react using vite, i set the project name to ./ to let it know that the project is in the current directory.

#### 4. now in the smart_contract I run npm init -y to create a package.json file.

#### 5. To allow our application to import every component in one line, i created a index.js file in the components folder and exported all the components in the folder.

#### 6. Ethers will allow us to interact with the blockhain and smart contracts

#### 7. We are using hardhat to creatr a structure for our smart contract. Hard hat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. Allow us to run solidity locally.

#### 8. I ran into some issues while installing hardhat the way jsmastery did. So i followed instructuion from the documentation here: https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/other-guides/waffle-testing
